# Game Design Playtest Page

After you have built your game and published it on your website, add a link to the playtest page, index.md in this repository.

To do this:

1. **Fork this repository** on that you can edit it and add your game.
1. **Click on the index.md file** and play around a bit to see how it works.
1. Then **click on the edit pencil** so you can look at the structure of the file. You will see that each of the sections looks something like this:

``` html
<details>
  <summary markdown="span">
    Adventure
  </summary>
  
  * [Adventure: Arnold Pierson]()
  
</details>
